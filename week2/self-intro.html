    <h1>Jason Lee Yong Ho</h1>

    <h2>Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.</h2>

    <p>I am not very good at communicating with strangers, but I enjoy spending my time doing things I love. My hobbies
        include playing games, traveling to new places, and modifying cars to make them look and perform better. I
        especially enjoy eating Japanese and Chinese food, as they are both delicious and full of flavor.
    </p>

    <p>My favorite
        quote is “Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions,” which reminds me to create my
        own joy in life. I also like watching anime, whether it's full of exciting battles or touching love stories.</p>
